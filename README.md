# ValSKA-HERA-beam-FWHM
A flexible and extensible package for validating the sensitivity of 21-cm power spectrum forward modelling approaches to imperfect knowledge of the FWHM of the interferometric primary beam. A case study modelling the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) with the BayesEoR modelling framework.
