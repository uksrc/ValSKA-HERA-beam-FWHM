    "* **Sky Model Plots**: \n",
    "  * Current results use GSM-based uvh5 files, so ideally, we should include either GSM or GSM+GLEAM.\n",
    "  * It would also be good to run / start running power spectrum analyses of the latter once available.\n",
    "* **Instrument Plots**:\n",
    "  * Antenna layout\n",
    "  * UV coverage\n",
    "  * Beam, including perturbation illustrations (c.f. PI27 progress plenary plots)\n",
    "* **Data Visualizations**: Potentially including (TBD, but beneficial to have on Confluence, at least):\n",
    "  * Dirty beam\n",
    "  * Dirty image\n",
    "  * Delay spectrum (if not too time-consuming)"
